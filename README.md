ScriptWriting

Scripts written by Ross Studtman

2014

The Heroes script was written and submitted to the Disney ABC Fellowship program in 2007. This episode of Heroes was written as the first episode of season two, meant to be the season opener. At the time the script was written season one had ended; I suppose this is how I had imagined I wanted season two to begin.

If you are or were a fan of Heroes you may remember season one was amazing but season two derailed itself a bit. Perhaps they should have read my script? Just kidding. I put a lot of time and effort into this, around about 2007, and I was very proud of this work and the accomplishment of actually writing my first script.

The Firefly script was written for practice. I'm mildly stunned, as I look back at my script writing files, how much work I did. I was actually surprised to find this fully formed Firefly script sitting in there. At this exact moment (2014) I've not reread the script so I hope it isn't too embarassing.
